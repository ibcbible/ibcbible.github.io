title: Our History
---
Immanuel Bible Church (IBC) was started in 1996 with a membership of about 10 to 14 people and one pastor, Nam Park. Services were originally held in the basement of a church in Hollywood and over the years moved geographically from Hollywood to Glendale to West Los Angeles to Santa Monica.

We are a non-denominational church that [believes](/doctrine/) in the full inerrancy of Scripture and that the Bible is the one and only authority for life and salvation. The purpose of our church is to exalt and glorify God and in so doing, we endeavor to equip believers so that they can be better trained to share their faith to their communities and their work places.
